* i love people and i prioritize face to face interaction over all else. 
* i control my devices; they do not control me. 
* all the tools and technologies i use are in service of [my vision](http://www.lawrencebarrinerii.com/vision) (which includes me, my communities, and the planet)
* my tools and practices are here to support me and people in my communities, particularly in the process of turning our thoughts and dreams into reality. 

this stance has many implications.

### the [tl;dr](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr)

* i check my email 1-2x/day
* my email response time is generally 24-72 hours
* i rarely check for new emails before 12p

--- 

### longer form protocol

* my (fluid) communication protocol hierarchy: 
    * face2face > video  call > phone call > voice message via imessage > hand-written letters > SMS or internet text messages > email
* i have almost all my notifications off on all my devices. i check in on them when it makes sense for me. 
* i try not to read new emails before 12p. the exception is if i'm working with people on something that is urgent. this allows me to maintain a pro-active mindset for my most productive hours, rather than a reactive one. 
* i may send emails before 12p. (this doesn’t contradict the above bullet).
* i try get to inbox zero on friday afternoons. 
* i tech sabbath (usually sundown friday to sundown saturday) at least 2x/month. 

### guiding principles

* “People tend to overestimate what can be done in one year and to underestimate what can be done in five or ten years.” — [J. C. R. Licklider, Book: “Libraries of the Future” (1965)](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/01/03/estimate/)
* “Remember that if you don’t prioritize your life someone else will.” 
― Greg Mckeown, Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less
* “A ‘no’ uttered from the deepest conviction is better than a ‘yes’ merely uttered to please, or worse, to avoid trouble.” — Mahatma Gandhi
