* i love people and i prioritize face to face interaction over all else. 
* i control my devices; they do not control me. 
* all the tools and technologies i use are in service of my vision (which includes me, my communities, and the planet)
* my tools and practices are here to support me and people in my communities, particularly in the process of turning our thoughts and dreams into reality. 
* there are a ton of implications of this stance.

### the [tl;dr](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr)

* my (fluid) communication protocol hierarchy: face2face > video  call > phone call > voice message via imessage > hand-written letters > SMS or internet text messages > email
* i have almost all my notifications off on all my devices. i check in on them when it makes sense for me. 
* i try not to read new emails before 12p. the exception is if i'm working with people on something that is urgent. this allows me to maintain a pro-active mindset for my most productive hours, rather than a reactive one. 
* i may send emails before 12p. (this doesnâ€™t contradict the above bullet).
* i try get to inbox zero on friday afternoons. 
* i tech sabbath at least 2x/month.
